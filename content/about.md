title: "About Me"
---

I’m a graduate student in Financial Engineering at HEC Montréal, with a background in Mathematics & Engineering from Queen’s University. I’m currently undertaking a QTEM Exchange, spending time studying in Amsterdam as part of my master’s program.

Outside of academic and professional work, I’m an endurance athlete and competitive sailor, with experience in long-distance running, triathlon, and varsity sailing. I love to travel; outside of Canada I've lived, studied, and worked in Miami, Edinburgh, and now Amsterdam. What interests me are projects that connect mathematical structure with real-world systems.
