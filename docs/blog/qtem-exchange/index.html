    <h2 id="what-is-qtem">What is QTEM?</h2>
<p>Despite being a mouthful of buzzwords (Quantitative Techniques for Economics and Management) that make a nice sounding acronym, the QTEM Network Masters network is not a standalone degree or a secret society for quants. At its core, it’s a structured program that sits on top of an existing master’s program, stitching together quantitative training, international study, and applied experience across a set of partner institutions.</p>
<p>It certainly influenced my decision to pursue a M.Sc. in Financial Engineering at HEC Montréal, as it offered the option (not the obligation) to plug into something broader if I chose to do so.</p>
<p>The QTEM network is made up of a few main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A home master’s degree</strong> (in my case, Financial Engineering)</li>
<li>A <strong>mandatory exchange</strong> semester at one of the partner universities, with a strong emphasis on quantitative coursework</li>
<li>A <strong>quantitative internship</strong>, intended to ground the theory</li>
<li>A <strong>data-driven group challenge</strong> (GBAC), framed around a real company problem</li>
</ul>
<p>In my eyes, QTEM is essentially an attempt to formalize something many students try to assemble informally: a network that provides technical depth, international connections, and applied work within a coherent structure.</p>
<p>At its best, it connects students, faculty, and corporate partners  across countries without being anchored to any one institution, an ambition that’s earned it <a href="https://www.qtem.org/qtem-featured-in-the-financial-times/">recognition from the Financial Times</a>.</p>
