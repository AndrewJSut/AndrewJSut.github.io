    <h1>Intro to the QTEM Program</h1>

    <h2 id="what-is-qtem">What is QTEM?</h2>
<p>Despite being a mouthful of buzzwords (Quantitative Techniques for Economics and Management) that make a nice-sounding acronym, the QTEM Masters network is not a standalone degree or a magic stamp that suddenly makes you employable. At its core, it’s a structured program that sits on top of an existing master’s degree, stitching together quantitative training, international study, and applied experience across a set of partner institutions.</p>
<p>It certainly influenced my decision to pursue an M.Sc. in Financial Engineering at HEC Montréal, as it offered the option (not the obligation) to plug into something broader if I chose to do so.</p>
<p>The QTEM network is made up of a few main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A home master’s degree</strong> (in my case, Financial Engineering)</li>
<li>A <strong>mandatory exchange semester</strong> at one of the partner universities, with a strong emphasis on quantitative coursework</li>
<li>A <strong>quantitative internship</strong>, intended to ground the theory</li>
<li>A <strong>data-driven group challenge</strong> (GBAC), framed around a real company problem</li>
</ul>
<p>In my eyes, QTEM is essentially an attempt to formalize something many students try to assemble informally: a network that provides technical depth, international connections, and applied work within a coherent structure.</p>
<p>At its best, it connects students, faculty, and corporate partners across countries without being anchored to any one institution, an ambition that’s earned it <a href="https://www.qtem.org/qtem-featured-in-the-financial-times/">recognition from the Financial Times</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>This winter semester (Feb–June), I’ll be participating in the exchange semester and the GBAC at the <strong>University of Amsterdam</strong>. As excited as I am, a decent amount of administrative work went into this, as the application process began last May.</p>
<p>After finishing my Math and Engineering degree at Queen’s University, I was keen to branch out from small-town Kingston and get a better sense of how the things I’m interested in are approached elsewhere. I’d already had a taste of that during my undergraduate exchange and internship in Edinburgh, which only reinforced how valuable it is to experience different academic and professional cultures. So when the QTEM exchange process kicked off, I was excited to start narrowing down partner universities.</p>
<p>The University of Amsterdam quickly rose to the top of my list: it has a strong quantitative finance ecosystem, but it’s also a place where sustainability is treated as a core value. Thanks to strong undergraduate grades, I was able to bypass the GMAT requirement, and by the end of the summer I had received my school’s nomination for UvA.</p>
<p>The administrative teams on both sides were incredibly helpful and generous with their time (Geneviève and Valérie at HEC Montréal, the international student team at UvA, and the many helpful people within QTEM). They made the process remarkably straightforward, for which I’m very grateful. For any students curious about the admission process for QTEM, please feel free to reach out, I’d be happy to help where I can.</p>
<h2 id="why-amsterdam">Why Amsterdam?</h2>
<p>Part of the appeal of Amsterdam is the practicality. It’s in a country with <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-english-proficiency-around-the-world/">the highest English proficiency among non-native speakers</a>, which removes one of the largest barriers to integration. It’s also famously built around bikes, with incredibly well-designed, walkable urban infrastructure, something those of you who know me will know I get disproportionately excited about.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Amsterdam made sense for my academic goals and personal values. The University of Amsterdam sits within a strong quantitative finance and econometrics ecosystem, partnering with leading fintech firms and sitting close to a broader research community spanning asset management, economics, and financial regulation. Additionally, there’s a seriousness to how sustainability, regulation, and capital allocation are discussed in the Netherlands that doesn’t feel superficial.</p>
<p>From the papers I’ve read coming out of Dutch institutions to the people I’ve had the chance to speak with, I’ve felt a sense of shared values that I strongly resonate with. This shows up both in everyday priorities (clean drinking water, recycling, and thoughtful urban planning) and in the academic work, including research that explicitly studies how markets price environmental damage (see, for example, this paper on the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5145959">price of pollution</a>).</p>
<h2 id="next-up">Next up</h2>
<p>After the long (and at times stressful) process of securing accommodation in Amsterdam, I’ll be on the Eurostar from London King’s Cross to Amsterdam Centraal at the end of January. I couldn’t be happier with my UvA course lineup, which consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stochastic Calculus</li>
<li>Reinforcement and Deep Learning</li>
<li>Advanced Risk Management</li>
<li>AI Impact Lab</li>
<li>Sustainable Finance</li>
<li>and the Global Business Analytics Challenge (GBAC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I still need to choose a Dutch football club to support, so all and any opinions are very much welcome (though my admiration for Arne Slot makes Feyenoord an attractive proposition).</p>
<p>I’ll be posting here and on LinkedIn, and I’m looking forward to sharing my experiences throughout the QTEM program.</p>
